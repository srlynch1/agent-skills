description: Retrieve and display Terraform Cloud/Enterprise run task results for a given run. Use this skill whenever the user asks about run task results, run task checks, task stage statuses, or wants to inspect what run tasks reported for a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise run. Triggers on phrases like "check the run tasks", "what did the run tasks say", "show run task results", "get task results for run-xxx", or any reference to run task outcomes on a specific run.

# Terraform Cloud/Enterprise Run Task Reader

The MCP terraform tools can fetch run details but lack endpoints for task stages, task results, and task result outcomes. This skill bridges that gap with a script that calls the TFC/TFE REST API directly, returning structured JSON with three layers of detail: **stages → task results → outcomes**.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the run

The user may provide either:

- A **run ID** like `run-iURWDL3wVxzefsjo`
- A **URL** like `https://app.terraform.io/app/org/workspaces/ws-name/runs/run-abc123`

Pass either form directly to the script — it handles both.

### Step 2: Fetch run task data

Run the script from its skill directory:

```bash
scripts/get-run-task-results.sh <run-id-or-url>
```

The script requires:

- `$TFE_TOKEN` — API token with read access to the workspace
- `$TFE_HOSTNAME` — (optional) hostname, defaults to `app.terraform.io`; auto-detected from URL input
- `$TFE_SKIP_VERIFY` — (optional) set to `true` to skip TLS verification (self-signed certs on TFE)
- `curl` and `jq` on PATH

The script uses `include=task_results` sideloading for efficiency (one API call for stages + results), then fetches outcomes and their HTML bodies per task result. It returns a single JSON object.

Parse the JSON output directly — do not save it to disk. Present the results inline.

### Step 3: Present structured results

Parse the JSON and present a markdown summary. The presentation has three tiers that mirror the data hierarchy:

**Tier 1 — Summary line** with aggregate counts from `summary`. Always include these counts in the user-facing response (not just in the raw JSON), even when all counts are zero:

```
**Total tasks**: 1 | Passed: 0 | Failed: 1 | Errored: 0
```

**Tier 2 — Stage sections** grouped by execution phase, each showing its task results table:

```
### Post-Plan Tasks (stage status: passed)

| Task Name | Status | Enforcement | Message | Link |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|------|
| Apptio-Cloudability | failed | advisory | Total Cost before: 31.54, after: 31.64, diff: +0.10 | [Results](url) |
```

**Tier 3 — Outcome sub-tables** under each task result that has outcomes:

```
#### Apptio-Cloudability — Outcomes

| Outcome | Description | Status | Severity |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Estimation | Cost Estimation Result | Passed | — |
| Policy | Policy Evaluation Result | Failed | Gated |
| Recommendation | Recommendation Result | Passed | — |
```

If an outcome has `body_html` content, render it in a collapsible block:

```
<details>
<summary>Policy Evaluation Detail</summary>

[HTML body content — failing resources, tag violations, etc.]

</details>
```

**Tier 4 — Actionable insights** after presenting the tables, synthesize the most important findings from the outcome bodies. The `body_html` content often contains the richest detail — specific failing resources, tag violations, cost savings recommendations, or compliance issues. Summarize these findings in plain language so the user doesn't have to parse raw HTML. For example:

> **Key findings:**
>
> - **Policy**: 23 resources failing — 22 missing `cost-center` tag (advisory), 1 EC2 instance using `t3.small` instead of required `t2.small` (gated)
> - **Cost**: Monthly impact +$0.10 USD, driven by a new CloudWatch metric alarm
> - **Recommendation**: Switch EC2 from `t3.small` to `t4g.small` for ~20% cost savings

This synthesis is what makes the skill output more valuable than just showing raw tables — it highlights what the user needs to act on.

### Handling edge cases

There are three distinct "empty" scenarios — distinguish between them clearly. In all cases, still show the Tier 1 summary line with explicit counts — this gives users a quick, scannable answer even when the counts are all zero:

1. **No task stages at all** (`task_stages` array is empty, `total_tasks` is 0): The workspace has no run tasks configured. Show: `**Total tasks**: 0 | Passed: 0 | Failed: 0 | Errored: 0` followed by "This run has no run tasks configured."

2. **Task stages exist but contain zero task results** (`task_stages` is non-empty but each stage's `task_results` array is empty, `total_tasks` is 0): The run task infrastructure exists but produced no individual results. Show: `**Total tasks**: 0 | Passed: 0 | Failed: 0 | Errored: 0` followed by "This run has task stages but no task results were produced. The stages are: [list stage names and statuses]."

3. **Task results exist but have zero outcomes** (`outcomes_count` is 0 for a task result): The task reported a status and message but no detailed breakdown. Show the task result row normally; skip the outcomes sub-table for that task.

This distinction matters because users asking "are there run tasks?" need to know whether tasks are configured (case 1 vs 2) and whether they produced detail (case 3).

### Reading the JSON output

**Task stage fields** (`task_stages[]`):

- `stage` — `pre_plan`, `post_plan`, `pre_apply`, `post_apply`
- `status` — stage-level status (can pass even when advisory tasks fail)
- `is_overridable`, `permissions` — override capability

**Task result fields** (`task_stages[].task_results[]`):

- `task_name` — Name of the run task
- `status` — `pending`, `running`, `passed`, `failed`, `errored`, `unreachable`
- `enforcement_level` — `advisory` (warning only) or `mandatory` (blocks run)
- `message` — Status message from the external service
- `url` — Link to external service results (if present). Include this in the Tier 2 table as a clickable link so users can jump to the full report in the external tool.
- `outcomes_count` — Number of outcome categories

**Outcome fields** (`task_stages[].task_results[].outcomes[]`):

- `outcome_id` — Category name. These vary by vendor — don't assume specific names like "Estimation" or "Policy". Present whatever categories the task returns.
- `description` — Human-readable description
- `tags` — Status/severity via `tags[].label == "Status"` → `tags[].value[0].label` and `tags[].label == "Severity"` → `tags[].value[0].label`
- `body_html` — Full HTML detail (may be null). When present, always extract and summarize key findings for the Tier 4 actionable insights.

The `summary` object has: `total_tasks`, `passed`, `failed`, `errored`, `pending`, `unreachable`.

Stage ordering (show in execution order): `pre_plan` → `post_plan` → `pre_apply` → `post_apply`. The script already sorts stages in this order.

### Highlighting problems

- If a task result has `status: errored` or `unreachable`, highlight it prominently — the external service failed to respond, not just a policy failure.
- If `enforcement_level` is `mandatory` and the task `failed`, note that this blocks the run from proceeding.
- If the stage `is_overridable`, mention that the stage can be manually overridden.

### Enriching with MCP run context

After fetching task results, also call `mcp__terraform__get_run_details` with the run ID to get complementary metadata: run status, trigger source, Terraform version, timestamps, and plan/apply state. This context helps the user understand where the run is in its lifecycle and why task results look the way they do. For example, knowing a run was triggered via CLI with auto-apply explains why it proceeded despite advisory failures.

Include relevant run metadata in your response — especially run status, trigger source, and whether the run has been applied.

## Error handling

- **Missing `$TFE_TOKEN`**: Script exits with a clear error. Suggest the user set the token.
- **HTTP 401/403**: Token lacks permissions or is expired. The error message includes the run ID.
- **HTTP 404**: Invalid run ID. The error message includes the run ID for debugging.
- **Script exits non-zero**: Surface the stderr output to the user — do not silently swallow errors or fabricate results.
